Thanks for using Froggy!

Froggy is a simple tool for quick movement of the text cursor.

The main movements have default keybindings:
- go up 5 lines = ctrl + up
- go down 5 lines = ctrl + down
- go up 10 lines = ctrl + alt + up
- go down 10 lines = ctrl + alt + down
- go to line start = ctrl + alt + left
- go to line end = ctrl + alt + right
- find the first/second/third whitespace on the left of the caret = ctrl + numpad1/numpad2/numpad3
- find the first/second/third whitespace on the right of the caret = ctrl + alt + numpad1/numpad2/numpad3
- expand selection up by 5 lines = ctrl + shift + up
- expand selection down by 5 lines = ctrl + shift + down
- expand selection up by 10 lines = ctrl + alt + shift + up
- expand selection down by 10 lines = ctrl + alt + shift + down
- expand selection to beginning of first line of the selection range = ctrl + alt + shift + left
- expand selection to end of last line of the selection range = ctrl + alt + shift + right

It's easy to remember these shortcuts: ctrl means jump close, ctrl + alt means jump far, adding shift means select instead of moving.
